# __Steps for Circle Coordinators__

## __Here are the steps required from Circle coordinators to facilitate members' payments.__

### __Collect wallet address__:

- Any change to the wallet address of a member or the adding of new members to the circle should be communicated to the operations circle to update our database records.

### __Audit circle members payment__:
- Navigate to the "Audit sheet"  tab of the members' task sheet and mark every audited task as audited while writing you name as the auditor. Here is an example:

![circlecoor1](circlecoor1.avif)

(Contact OC if you need to add memberâ€™s information so that we create a designated Task Sheet for them)

### __Payment Request__:
- Once the auditing is done, the coodinator can request a payment for the member through the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-F80D5RC5R_pTvuhihMy8LKdCtZWEl44a5NLe3QAzplJSgg/viewform?usp=dialog).
