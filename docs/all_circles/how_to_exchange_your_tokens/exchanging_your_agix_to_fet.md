# __Exchanging your AGIX to FET__

## This method follows a two step process:

### __STEP 1 - Convert AGIX on Cardano (ADA) to Ethereum (ETH) Using a Token Bridge__

1. __[Set Up Your Wallets](https://df-manual.gitbook.io/df-book/all-circles/wallet-creation-for-recieving-payments)__

    - Ensure you have a Cardano-compatible wallet (e.g., Eternl, Lace) holding your AGIX tokens.

    - Set up an Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for receiving the converted tokens.

2. __Access the Token Bridge__

    - Navigate to the official [Singularitynet Token Bridge](https://bridge.singularitynet.io/).

3. __Connect Your Wallets__

    - Connect your Cardano wallet to the bridge for sending AGIX (Cardano).

    - Connect your Ethereum wallet to the bridge for receiving AGIX (Ethereum).

4. __Specify the Conversion Details__

    - Select AGIX (Cardano) as the token youâ€™re converting.

    - Specify the amount of AGIX to transfer.

    - Select AGIX (Ethereum) as the target token.

5. __Confirm the Conversion__

    - Review the transaction details, including fees

    - Approve the transaction in your Cardano wallet.

6. __Wait for Confirmation__

    - The bridge will process the transaction. The AGIX(ETH) will appear in your Ethereum wallet.

### __STEP 2 - Convert AGIX on Ethereum to FET Using the SingularityDAO Migration Tool__

1. __Access the Migration Tool__

    - Visit the [SingularityDAO Migration Tool](https://www.singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi) platform.

2. __Connect Your Ethereum Wallet__

    - Use the wallet holding your converted AGIX (now on Ethereum) to connect to the migration tool.

3. __Select AGIX for Conversion__

    - Choose AGIX (Ethereum) as the source token.

4. __Review Conversion Details__

    - Check the exchange rate, fees, and other transaction specifics.


5. __Approve the Transaction__

    - Approve the migration tool to access your AGIX tokens by confirming a transaction in your wallet.

    - Confirm the conversion to FET.


6. __Receive FET Tokens__

    - Once the transaction is processed, FET tokens will appear in your Ethereum wallet. You can now proceed to transfer your FET tokens to any listed exchanges and make a swap if needed.
