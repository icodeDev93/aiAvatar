# üõ†Ô∏è Main Tools and Environments

We started out building our own DF website, which we further developed into a full-featured Proposal and project portal. However, we have other communication needs as well. To enable multiple teams develop different feature sets in parallel, we have identified 3 separate frontend environments:

1. **[Deepfunding.ai](https://deepfunding.ai)**; our main proposal portal for all functions and features for proposing and awarded teams and interested community members

2. **[Community.deepfunding.ai](https://community.deepfunding.ai)**; our new community-based site for all information about townhalls and events, Circles, Workgroups (TB developed), and news and notification. This website should function as a single source of truth for all news and events as well as giving information about the operational layer of DF and enabling us to recruit new community members for DF tasks. 

3. **[Developer.deepfunding.ai](https://developer.deepfunding.ai)**; The portal for developers, featuring detailed profile information, closely connected to the reputation system, updates and posts about projects, RFPs, jobs, ideas, etc., and dashboards to access all relevant information easily, such as a project dashboard and a job listing page.
