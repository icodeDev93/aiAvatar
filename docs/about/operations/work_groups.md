# __Work Groups__

Not all topics can be effectively discussed in a group of 20-30 people and some topics require multiple sessions for a deeper dive. Work groups were created to focus on a certain topic with a smaller group of committed Circle members for a limited period.

A nice side effect is that a workgroup usually consists of members from different circles (or community members) which helps to build bridges across Circles that otherwise risk becoming siloed. This is a relatively young initiative, still in an experimental phase.
