# üèÜ __Main Awarded *Tooling* projects in DF__

## **Reputation platform**

**Phase 1**: We started early with reputation tooling. Photrek delivered First an intermediate solution developed by Rober Haas based on this awarded project: [Community contribution scores](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/community-contribution-scores/). Final report doc: [Final report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/107efB0LVgg__xArEdMu9-Rb5GZAAewBKcvChwJ1oLn4/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs){ data-preview }

**Phase 2**: In a next iteration this has become a well-built solution that was first used in DFR4: [Community Engagement scores](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/community-engagement-scores/){ data-preview }  Because it was ready just in time without too much testing we decided, to use the platform to test the automation, calculations, and output, but do this based on the old and simpler algorithms. This first run of the platform was executed successfully. Before round 5 we are setting up the Data Analytics team that will have the responsibility to evaluate the platform, the algorithms, and configurations, so we can use the full-fledged functionality in DFR5

**Simulation engine**

I had some discussions with Kenric from the Photrek team on ‚ÄòQuadratic Voting‚Äô as defined in this Article: [Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting#:~:text=Quadratic%20voting%20is%20a%20rated,and%20tyranny%20of%20the%20majority.){ data-preview } The discussion centered around the question of whether the principles of this system can be 1:1 translated to the context of DF. Specifically on how the principle of ‚Äòstrength of opinion in Quadratic Voting would interact with our 'graded voting‚Äô system. This led to this RFP: [Simulating The Quality Of Community Decisions](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/simulating-the-quality-of-community-decisions/){ data-preview }. I voiced my concern about having all these systems in the hands of a single team, which led to the creation of a 'Red team‚Äù consisting of a critical and capable community member (Walter Karshat) and an esteemed SNET scientist (Debbie Duong), to critically follow the decisions and developments around voting and reputation.  

__Reputation workshop__ 

A community initiative to explore the concept: [Facilitate A ‚ÄúReputation ‚Äì Focus Group‚Äù](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/facilitate-a-reputation-focus-group/){ data-preview } by a number of internal and external workshops resulted in this final deliverable: [DFR3-IDT9 Final Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghLOLB9sUMuyxlQ8GXkSsH10_k0gPN3R90FyD3ZBwm0/edit){ data-preview }

**2 RFP design proposals**

To kickstart the 'community-driven RFP process, and as an experiment to have a part of the ideation phase fully community-governed. The idea of an RFP design proposal is to do some research in preparation for a full RFP, which would ultimately lead to a proposal being awarded to build the defined tooling. 

1. **RFP Design proposal by Photrek**: [Reputation & Voting Weight System](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/intelligent-ocular-image-processing/){ data-preview }. This proposal aims to research the possibilities for extending the platform: ‚Äúdefining high-level requirements for a suite of microservices to export crucial data, developing an adaptive algorithm layer for dynamic engagement and voting score calculations, and constructing a robust knowledge graph for comprehensive data integration.‚Äù These requirements were defined in collaboration with me (Jan) and have the higher goal of making the system more flexible and thereby adaptable by other projects, eventually making reputation scores ‚Äòliquid‚Äô across different projects.  

2. **RFP Design proposal by RnDAO/Togethercrew**: https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/improved-reputation-sytem-for-governance-rfp/  The investigations have started, and it's interesting to see that their approach is much less technical, and more directed to people, needs and context, making their approach complementory to the Photrek approach. 

## **Content Knowledge Graph**

This was started as a community initiative in Q3 2023 and took a long time to mature. The reason for creating this is a perceived risk of funded projects dissolving into a wide variety of isolated and potentially half-finished or abandoned repositories. The envisioned solution was a KG project with separate features and RFP options including:

1. The basic Knowledge Graph

2. Import of data sets including DF content, SNET content, Hyperon, platform content, etc. 

3. A tool to browse and visualize the data

4. Solutions on top of the KG such as a Q&A avatar and educational courses

5. A mechanism to maintain and update the data, by means of flagging wrong or outdated data and a paid, reputation-driven process of updating the flagged data

Current status: The team decided to start with a foundational solution (#1) and build an MVP around DF Data (#2).
