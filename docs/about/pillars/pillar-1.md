## **Main rules and processes**: 

- Anyone can submit a proposal. The community decides by means of a voting process which project will be awarded. 

- The basis for voting weight is token holdings. additionally, we use reputation as an extra lever and protection against Sybil attacks. 

- We started with the main principle of milestone-based disbursements, which avoids a lot of overhead, by making the teams responsible for delivering milestone outcomes to get paid. 

- Another important point is ‘Grade voting’, a system based on grades 1-10. 

- Frequency: currently a round twice a year seems optimal, especially with ongoing RFPs at the same time. As we are maturing we are better able to schedule these rounds at fixed dates.

## **Top 3 Main improvements in the pipeline**:

1. Better integration of the **reputation** system with more advanced algorithms. Also, some kind of **light KYC** would be very helpful

2. Improve **quality** of the projects, possibly by having a more gated process and fewer proposals prefiltered for the voting space

3. Ensure **scalability** of the processes by automation, community expert integration, and -possibly- required tasks for proposers/awarded teams.
