This is in an early development stage. Originally the idea was to have a third staff member next to **Jan** and **Raphael**. However, some community members rose to the occasion and requested to build this up grass-roots way. We have now a defacto ‘**Developer Outreach Circle**’ that is working on some experiments around Hackathons. There may also turn out to be some overlap with the ‘**Events Circle**’ that is in charge of (regional, central) Town halls and similar events. The aim is to make town halls more targeted at onboarding new proposers and awarded teams. 

We may still conclude that a full-time coordinator role is desired for this, but for now, that role has been postponed.
