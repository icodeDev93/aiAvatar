# __Individual Channels for Proposals__

For specific discussions on individual proposals, we will create by-demand channels that will be used to have direct and private discussions between awarded teams and the reviewers, this is where you are able to raise any issues or challenges you may face and would like to discuss in a more private setup.

<mark>These channels will only be created if it's absolutely necessary</mark>.
