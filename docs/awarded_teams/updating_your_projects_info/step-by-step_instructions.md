# __Step-by-step instructions__

## __Here is the Full process of requesting a change__:

1. The Team lead has an information they’d like to update about their project (i.e. Wallet Address change, Milestone change, Main contact change, …).

2. The team selects the updates to be made in the following [form](https://forms.gle/sK3Qa1sQNx5uqj8h6). (The email registered in the form should match the contact email provided earlier)

3. A GitHub issue is then created automatically on GitHub for the update, the issue is also assigned to the coordinator of the relevant circle for that specific change.

4. The coordinator reaches out to the main contact of the team to confirm the change requested on Mattermost.

5. Once the change is confirmed, the coordinator applies the change.

6. Finally, the coordinator informs the main contact that the change has been implemented.

7. Finally, the coordinator closes the issue after adding a comment including any relevant information.
