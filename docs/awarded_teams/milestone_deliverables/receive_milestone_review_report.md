# __Receive Milestone Review Report__

Once the Reviewing process is done, the coordinator will send you a report explaining:

- The scope of the review.

- Whether the deliverable was accepted or not.

- If rejected, a list of things that should be remediated.

In the case of rejection, the proposer should implement the changes suggested by the reviewer and resubmit the milestone through the [Google form](https://forms.gle/4peoMkSDFqdRLNCT6). 

The proposer can also disagree with the report's conclusion but will have to substantiate their claims to the coordinator they are in contact with.
